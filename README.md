## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex-box
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 1024px) {
  
  body {
    max-width: 1024px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 0 20px;
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }

  header img {
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    margin-top: 1rem;
    border-radius: 20px;
  }
}
```
Simple media query I'm proud of because I'm just getting use to using these queries and this seemed so simple. Makes me curious of how well I will get along with using media queries.

### Continued development

As stated above I am exited to continue using these media queries in future projects. I think it will be challenging, frustrating but fun trying to figure out how to make things flow naturally when the browser screens are adjusted.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - As always W3 Schools coming in clutch with the all the useful information.
- [css tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - Discovered this page a while back and man has changed the way I see css, not only is the information amazing but the interactive aspect of the information is great especially when it visually shows you how things work.
